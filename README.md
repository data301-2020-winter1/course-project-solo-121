## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Within this project I hope to understand and highlight the statistical differences in movies and tv shows that are released on the popular streaming service Netflix among countries and how that could affect Netflix's development or publication of future entertainment.  Additional cross references will be made to verify the database’s data in show ratings with external databases such as IMDB to ensure verified material.  I am interested in this topic because Netflix has become such a ‘normal’ part of the average North American lifestyle.  Most Americans own a Netflix membership which leads me to wonder more about how the service collects data and uses said data to create profitable in-house shows.  There specific question I mainly want answered has largely to do with how the highlighted variables in director, country of release, and type affect the show’s rating to attempt to give reason on how Netflix conducts business practices based on their data.  I can imagine building a dashboard for this topic as there are many variables and interesting facts to discover that will allow me to fill out the dashboard with a variety of unique reports from the dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset that is chosen is one that focuses on the content available on Netflix whether it be international or region specific.  The variables of interest in the dataset include the type, category, directory, country the movie was added in, rating, and type.  The dataset was created with the use of a third-party software known as Flixable which is Netflix specific search engine.  The data collected begins as early as 2008 with the most recent data additions being within 2019.  Within the description of the dataset, the data was collected in the interest of understanding what content is released in certain regions, identifying similar based content based on matching features, and observing the trend between movies/tv shows.  This database also relates to the Flixable report that described that movies have declined in comparison to past records largely with tv shows increasing in contrast to the movie output’s decrease.  Other noteworthy mentions about the dataset is that the dataset includes show id’s and a filter on each actor to filter out a single cast member to observe if a single cast member’s profile can affect the show’s performance in relation to international or domestic viewers.
